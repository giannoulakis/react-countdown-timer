# React Countdown Timer

## A minimal timer to improve focus :godmode:

**Start 1 pomodoro**

Personally I find this a very effective method to focus and get things done.

Breaking down tasks into micro-tasks (around 10 minute each), starting a countdown timer and challenging myself to finish the task before the timer ends. :hourglass:

**Parkinson's law:**
> Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion

I keep it in a small corner of my desktop, with an always visible list of clear actions :memo:. It reminds me of what I'm doing and how much time I have left.
